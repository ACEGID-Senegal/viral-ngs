viral-ngs
=========

A set of scripts and tools for the analysis of viral NGS data.  More 
details to come.


Scripts:
 1. taxon_filter.py - filter reads for or against certain species, genera,
   or other taxonomic classifications
 2. consensus.py - assemble reads, clean contigs, re-map and refine
   consensus assemblies
 3. interhost.py - align consensus sequences, call SNPs, annotate, produce
   trees
 4. intrahost.py - align reads back to consensus and call intrahost
   variants
 5. ncbi.py - submission scripts for Genbank and SRA
