Description of the methods
==========================

Much more documentation to come...

TO DO: here we will put a high level description of the various tools that
exist here, perhaps with some pictures and such. We will describe why we
used certain tools and approaches / how other approaches fell short / what
kinds of problems certain steps are trying to solve.  Perhaps some links to
papers and such.  Kind of a mini-methods paper here.


Viral genome analysis
---------------------

*De novo* assembly, reference assisted assembly improvements,
gene annotaion, species-level variation, within-host variation, etc.


Taxonomic read filtration
-------------------------

Especially human read depletion (prior to submission to NCBI SRA).
But also the part where we restrict to a particular taxa of interest
(the species you're studying).


Taxonomic read identification
-----------------------------

Nothing much here at the moment. That comes later, but we will later
integrate it when it's ready.
